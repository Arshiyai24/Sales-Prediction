# TASK 3 📊 Sales Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview

Sales prediction is a crucial task for businesses to forecast revenue and plan strategically. The ability to estimate future sales based on advertising spend, target audience segmentation, and platform selection can give companies a significant competitive edge. 

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze how advertising budget and strategy affect product sales.
- Preprocess and clean the dataset for better model performance.
- Train machine learning models to predict future sales.
- Evaluate the performance of different models.
- Visualize insights and predictions to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🧠 What I Learn

- Data analysis and visualization
- Data preprocessing (handling null values, encoding, scaling)
- Model selection and training (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score)
- Drawing business insights from machine learning predictions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset
